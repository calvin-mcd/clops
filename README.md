# clops

clops is a qazlike unibody split sub40s keyboard. The KLE and firmware is by ha ha ha which itself is inspired by a [KLE](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/c3c008118662d8631bc35f2af838a2c1) from [Noelle](https://github.com/fivedee). PCB is designed by Calvin0563. It sports a rp2040 and hotswap socket, and supports 1 center rotary encoder and 1 bottom row roller encoder.

## Build Guide

When installing the Roller encoder be sure to remove the plastic clips where the encoder slots into the pcb cut out and make sure it is aligned to your satisfaction with the centre of the pcb before soldering!

## Firmware

The firmware was written by ha ha ha and both the flash file and source code can be found in the firmware folder.

## Case

[protieusz](https://github.com/protieusz) has designed a 3d printable case for the clops. It can be found here:
